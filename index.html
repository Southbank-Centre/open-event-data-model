      <h2>What is the Open Event Data Model?</h2>
      <p>The Open Event Data Model (OEDM) is an open source standard for sharing cultural event data between systems and users. The OEDM provides a flexible model for describing the various entities associated with events, including the people, places and things associated with the event. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/schema/">Read more about the OEDM</a>.</p>
      <p>In addition to publishing the model on these pages, we are also encouraging the development of a range of tools that are built around the OEDM. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apps">Find out about other projects related to OEDM</a>.</p>
