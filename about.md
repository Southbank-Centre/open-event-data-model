#About the Open Event Data Model
The OEDM is a group of organisations and individuals dedicated to maintaining and expanding an open data model and associated ontologies and controlled vocabularies for performing arts and cultural events. The OEDM organisation will be the standards body for the model and will also promote the model's use. We encourage participation from all interested parties. 

## Organisations and their members

###Southbank Centre
Southbank Centre passionately believes the arts have the power to transform lives. We also believe that the arts must be available to all of us â€“ and this lies at the heart of all we do.

Southbank Centre is a world-famous arts centre on the South Bank of the Thames. Created in 1951 for the Festival of Britain, Southbank Centre draws on its heritage as a festival site, with art and activities inside and outside. We encourage everyone to become involved in the arts in new and creative ways.

###Barbican Centre
The Barbican is Europe's largest multi-arts and conference venue presenting a diverse range of art, music, theatre, dance, film and creative learning events. It is also home to the London Symphony Orchestra

###Plus or Minus Seven
Plus or Minus Seven are digital transformation specialists. We help organisations reinvent themselves for the digital age through strategic advice and support in developing data-centric digital environments.

## History

The Open Event Data Model came out of the digital transformation work the Southbank Centre undertook. In order to improve the efficiency of the organisation and to create a platform to offer new digital services to its audiences, the initial version of the OEDM was developed. After being successfully piloted as part of an enhanced event offering, the Barbican Centre was interested in model and how it might apply to their events.

After a number of workshops and iterations, the OEDM was tested with various other performing arts organisations and event spaces. Thanks to these interactions, we were able to refine the OEDM to a full release version. While the Southbank Centre and Barbican continue to be sponsors of the OEDM, the model is designed to apply to any organisation's events.
